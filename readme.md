## Description

PianoHero is an interactive browser game modeled after Guitar Hero. It guides players through playing a melody on a virtual piano by hitting corresponding keys on their keyboard. Players are scored on how accurately they hit the notes, but can also set aside the guided songs to play any tune they like.

### Powerful

SafeScroll is a powerful tool for screening out unwanted material, whether it's a relatively rare term or a name that's over the news. Here we're blocking all stories related to Donald Trump on the New York Times, and unhidden a Trump-related article on the LATimes that we decided we wanted to peek at (notice the toggle-able unlock symbol in the top-right corner of the article heading).
